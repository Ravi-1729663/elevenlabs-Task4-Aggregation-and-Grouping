# Task 4 â€“ Aggregate Functions & Grouping in SQL

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the use of **SQL aggregate functions** and **grouping operations** using the `connects` database.  
It focuses on **COUNT, SUM, AVG** functions and the use of **GROUP BY** and **HAVING** clauses to summarize and analyze social media data.

**Objective:**  
- Learn how to perform **data aggregation and summarization** in SQL.  
- Understand how to group data, calculate metrics, and filter aggregated results.  
- Gain practical skills in generating insights for **user activity, post engagement, and content analysis**.  

---

## Tools Used
- **MySQL 8.0+**  
- **MySQL Workbench** (for executing queries and visualizing results)  

---

## Database Setup
- **Database Name:** `connects`  
- Pre-existing tables used: `Users`, `Posts`, `Comments`, `Reactions`, `Post_Hashtag`.  
- SQL scripts include `IF NOT EXISTS` checks to avoid errors.

## Task Details

| Function / Clause | Description |
|------------------|-------------|
| `COUNT()`        | Counts rows in a table or non-null values in a column. Useful for measuring total users, posts, or comments. |
| `SUM()`          | Calculates the total of numeric values. Useful for total likes or reaction counts. |
| `AVG()`          | Calculates the average value. Useful for average likes per post or average comments per user. |
| `GROUP BY`       | Groups rows sharing a common value to calculate aggregates per group. |
| `HAVING`         | Filters groups after aggregation, similar to `WHERE` but for grouped data. |
| `ORDER BY`       | Sorts results, often used to rank aggregated data. |
